## PokeDex
PokeDex is a web application that allows users to search for and view information about their favorite Pokémon. The application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and uses the PokéAPI to retrieve information about Pokémon.

## Usage
To search for a Pokémon, simply enter the name or ID number of the Pokémon in the search bar and hit "Enter" or click the "Search" button. If the Pokémon is found, its name, image, type(s), and some basic stats (such as HP, Attack, Defense, etc.) will be displayed.

You can also browse through a list of all Pokémon by clicking the "All Pokémon" button in the navigation bar. Clicking on a Pokémon in the list will take you to its details page.
